## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You're gonna need [Python](https://www.python.org/) (obviously).

More specifically, the modules in this package were made in Python 3.6.3.
Any version of Python past 3 (i.e. 3.*) should work just as well though.

### Installing

Simply download/clone this repo/package, unzip it, and treat it as you would
any other Python Package.

If you want to import the whole package, simply add this statement:

```python
import my_modules
```

to the top of your Python program code.

If you only want to import one of the modules in this package, then
that can be done just as easily:

```python
from my_modules import module_name
```

Where module_name is the name of the desired module to import

## Running the tests

Currently, unit tests aren't set up for these modules (yet!).
However, the main functions of each module do contain small tests/demos of
their module's functionality.

To run these, simply run that module by itself (preferably in a shell or IDE).

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With

- [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html) - Module for GUI development
- [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) - Module for
getting the current date and time

## Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish
to make via issue, email, or any other method with me beforehand.

## Versioning

I'm using [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning (Currently on version 1.0.0!).
